# LIRI

This assignment was designed to test our Node.js prowess. We used the Spotify API, OMDB API, and Bands in Town API. We had to have multiple files be able to communicate with one another in order to return relevant information while at the same time not giving away our personal API keys. 

concert-this used the Bands in Town API and provided information regarding the band's next concert venue, city location, and date in moment.js MM/DD/YYYY format. It returned information about Skrillex on a bad call.

spotify-this-song utilized the Spotify API to return track name, artist name, song name, spotify link, and album name. It provided information for "Ace of Base" on a bad call.

movie-this returned the movie title, year, IMDB rating, Rotten Tomatoes Rating, Country Produced, Language, Plot, and Actors for what ever comes after that syntax. It returned information for Mr. Nobody on a bad call though.
